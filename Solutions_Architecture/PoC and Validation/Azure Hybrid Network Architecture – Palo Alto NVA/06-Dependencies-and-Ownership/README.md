- NVA load balancer health probe logic

## On-Premises Dependencies
- Additional VPN tunnel configuration
- On-premises routing changes to support split-transit

## Ownership Boundaries

- On-premises changes fall outside current operational ownership
- Any production implementation would require a formally scoped PS engagement
