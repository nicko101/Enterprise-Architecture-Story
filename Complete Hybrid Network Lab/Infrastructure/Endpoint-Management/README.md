# Endpoint Management: Microsoft Intune Integration

## Overview
This section documents the endpoint management and compliance control plane for the hybrid Zero Trust environment. Microsoft Intune is used as the authoritative service for device configuration, posture assessment, and compliance enforcement across both cloud-native and hybrid-joined endpoints.

The design follows a **compliance-first security model**, where endpoint health and identity directly influence access decisions across the network and application layers. Devices that do not meet defined security baselines are automatically restricted through downstream enforcement systems.

This implementation supports both cloud-only and hybrid identity scenarios and integrates tightly with certificate-based authentication, identity services, and network access control.

---

## Architectural Role
Microsoft Intune operates as the **endpoint governance layer** within the broader Zero Trust architecture.

Its responsibilities include:
- Establishing device trust through configuration and certificate delivery
- Continuously evaluating endpoint security posture
- Publishing compliance signals to external enforcement points
- Automating remediation and configuration drift correction

Intune does not function in isolation. It acts as a control-plane service that feeds validated device state into identity and network enforcement systems.

## Core Management Capabilities

### Device Enrollment and Lifecycle
Endpoints are enrolled using Azure AD Join or Autopilot-based provisioning workflows. Enrollment establishes a persistent device identity in Microsoft Entra and brings the device under management without requiring domain membership.

Supported enrollment models include:
- Cloud-only Azure AD Join
- Hybrid Azure AD Join (where applicable)

Once enrolled, devices remain continuously managed regardless of network location.

### Certificate-Based Identity Distribution
All managed endpoints rely on certificate-based identity rather than passwords for network authentication.

Key characteristics:
- Device certificates are issued via SCEP using an on-premises NDES service
- Certificate profiles are delivered and renewed automatically through Intune
- Certificates are used for EAP-TLS and TEAP authentication across wired and wireless networks

This ensures that device identity is cryptographically verifiable and resistant to credential-based attacks.

---

### Configuration Profiles
Intune configuration profiles enforce standardized security and connectivity settings across all endpoints.

Examples include:
- Wired and wireless 802.1X profiles using certificate-based authentication
- Platform security baselines for Windows endpoints
- Network and system hardening policies aligned with enterprise standards

Profiles are scoped dynamically using Entra ID groups, enabling flexible targeting without manual device management.

---

### Compliance Policies
Compliance policies define the minimum security posture required for an endpoint to be considered trusted.

Typical compliance signals include:
- Disk encryption status (BitLocker)
- Operating system version and patch level
- Antivirus and endpoint protection state
- Device integrity and configuration health

Devices that fall out of compliance are immediately flagged, and their compliance state is updated in real time.

---

### Integration with Network Enforcement
Compliance results generated by Intune are consumed by downstream enforcement systems to make access decisions.

Key integration points:
- Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access
- Aruba ClearPass for wired and wireless network admission
- Palo Alto Networks NGFW for segmentation and quarantine enforcement

This ensures that access is granted based on **current device health**, not just successful authentication.

---

### Application Deployment and Scripting
Intune is also used to standardize the endpoint software environment.

Capabilities include:
- Automated deployment of required security agents and utilities
- PowerShell-based configuration scripts
- Proactive remediation tasks to correct configuration drift

These mechanisms reduce operational overhead and ensure consistent security posture across the fleet.

---

## Security Model Summary
The endpoint management design enforces the following principles:

- Devices must be known, enrolled, and compliant to access resources
- Network location does not imply trust
- Certificates replace passwords for machine authentication
- Compliance state is continuously evaluated and enforced
- Access can be revoked automatically without manual intervention

This aligns endpoint governance with Zero Trust principles across identity, network, and security domains.

- Identity Plane (Microsoft Entra)  
  Provides user and device identity, enrollment authority, and policy scope.

- Active Directory (Hybrid Trust Services)  
  Supports certificate issuance and legacy integration where required.

## Scope and Intent
This documentation represents a production-aligned implementation of endpoint management within a hybrid Zero Trust architecture. All configurations described here are actively deployed, validated, and integrated with identity and network enforcement layers.

The intent is to demonstrate how endpoint compliance can be elevated from a device-only concern to a first-class security control across the entire environment.
