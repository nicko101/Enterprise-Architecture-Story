# In-Scope Delivery

## Delivered Solution
Due to time constraints and emerging routing complexities, the delivery pivoted to a direct on-premises to Palo Alto NVA VPN connection for the new site.

The delivered solution achieved:
- Internet breakout via the Palo Alto NVA
- Inspection of on-premises ↔ Azure traffic for the new site
- Removal of dependency on GatewaySubnet route manipulation for the new site

## Outcome
This approach met all agreed success criteria within the project timeline and stabilised connectivity under operational pressure.

No changes were made to existing legacy site connectivity as part of this delivery.
